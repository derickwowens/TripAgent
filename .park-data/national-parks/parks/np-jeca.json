    "description": "Jewel Cave National Monument is a day-use area and is available for outdoor recreation on a daily basis throughout the year. However, although the monument is normally open for surface activities year round, the visitor center, park store, and ranger-guided cave tours and operational hours vary from season to season. This means that the surface features and recreational areas are open year round, yet staffing levels and visitor services may be limited during the off-season."
