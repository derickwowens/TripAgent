    "description": "Boston National Historical Park is a unique collaboration of federally, municipally, and privately owned and operated historic sites. Most of the park is along Boston's Freedom Trail®, a 2.5 mile (4 km) walking path marked by a red brick or painted line weaving through Downtown Boston, the North End, and Charlestown.\n\nThe trail itself is outdoors and open year round. Every site along the trail has its own hours which vary throughout the season. Please check ahead before planning your visit."
