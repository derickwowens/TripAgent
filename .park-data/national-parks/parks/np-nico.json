    "weatherDescription": "Northwest Kansas has a four-season climate typified by long, hot summers, cold winters, short spring and fall seasons, and a nearly constant breeze. Humidity is relatively low compared to the eastern portion of the state. Afternoon thunderstorms with lightning, hail, and gusty winds frequently occur during the spring and summer. Tornados are possible but are less common in Kansas than they are in several other states. Snow accumulation from winter blizzards occasionally causes site to close."
