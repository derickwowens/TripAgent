  "description": "People first arrived in the Chesapeake Bay during the last ice age. As glaciers melted, diverse societies learned to thrive in a world of water. When Englishman Captain John Smith explored the Bay in 1608, he documented hundreds of American Indian communities. Today, sites on his map are archeological treasures and sacred sites for tribal citizens. Come join us on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay!",

    "description": "The water trail is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year! To launch your kayak or other vessel on the trail, access a local boat launch along one of the trail's many tributary rivers and coastlines. Local boat launches, state parks, and other locations have specific operating hours and seasons. Always check weather and conditions before going out on the water - take care during the winter months to dress appropriately for the weather and the possibility of submersion in cold water."

    "weatherDescription": "During the summer season, visitors should dress in light, comfortable, moisture-wicking clothing, and use sunscreen. High temperatures and humidity create a higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. We strongly recommended you carry a bottle of water with you and wear a life jacket at all times. During the winter, be aware that submersion in freezing cold water can be deadly. If you are going out, bring safety gear such as a wetsuit and practice techniques to avoid tipping over."
