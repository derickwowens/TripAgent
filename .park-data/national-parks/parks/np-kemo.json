Though we are located north of Atlanta, we're still have the same hot summers and mild winters as our neighbors. The mountain top generally ranges 8-10 degrees cooler than at the base. In fall and winter, be prepared with a light weight jacket on hand. After planning your activities, check back to see what the weather will have in store for your day."
