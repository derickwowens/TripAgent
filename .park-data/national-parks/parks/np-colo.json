    "weatherDescription": "During the summer season visitors should dress in light, comfortable clothing, wear comfortable shoes and use sunscreen. We recommended you carry a bottle of water with you. High temperatures and high humidity create higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Most of the Historic site is out-of-doors and although not a great distance from an air-conditioned building, staying properly hydrated will help prevent these illnesses. During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available."
