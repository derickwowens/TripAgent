Summers are warm, with daytime temps in the 90s F (32-37 C) and low humidity in May, June, and July. The summer rainy season (monsoon) is between late June and early September. Monsoon thunderstorms can cause flash floods. Winter temps can fall below freezing at night, with highs 40-60 F (4-15 C)."
