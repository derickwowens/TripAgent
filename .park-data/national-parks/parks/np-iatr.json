The Trail is open year round. However some segments may be closed during Wisconsin's November 9-day gun deer hunting season. Additional information about hunting seasons, trail conditions and closures along the rest of the trail is available from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Ice Age Trail Alliance."
