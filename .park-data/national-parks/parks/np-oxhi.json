Dress for the season, light clothes in summer, layers in spring and fall, and warm coats in winter. Cooler days are often the best days to visit Oxon Hill Farm if you’re interested in seeing farm animals or wildlife out and about. There are still lots of things to see and do on hotter days, just make sure to keep hydrated and take frequent breaks."
